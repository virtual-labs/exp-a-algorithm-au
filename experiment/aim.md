## Aim of the experiment
A* Search algorithm is one of the best and popular techniques used in path-finding and graph traversals.It is a searching algorithm that is used to find the shortest path between an initial and a final point.
The A* Search Algorithm also uses a heuristic function that provides additional information regarding how far away from the goal node we are.
The objective is to determine routes utilizing the A* algorithm, which are contingent upon the input provided by the user.
