# Procedure

## Create the Graph and set the search parameters:
step1:Enter no of nodes and no of links \
Step2:Select from custom or random options to create graph \
Step3:Enter Source Node and Destination Node \
Step4:Click on Find path to start the search 

Custom graph can also be created if you select custom graph option 
To modify node labels, heuristic values, and the cost of a path,
you may utilize the interactive feature by selecting the specific node and entering the desired values. 

## Generate solution:
Visualize the steps 
Visualize the path from selecting a starting point on the graph and then following a the heuristic function
Iterations can be animated; paths can be highlighted.
The result will be a path which displays the end of the search.

## Evaluate :
Define following:	
Path and algorithm iterations
